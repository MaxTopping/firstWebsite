<h1>My Story</h1>
  <p>On October 27th, it was stormy night in south-michigan; from this storm came a great blessing: I was birthed. I was one of 300 christmas puppies birthed that night. My mom was very tired. Early on I tried to assert my dominance over my littermates because i:alpha. I would swallow my entire bowl of food with in 10 seconds. Eventually I became too alpha, and all of my littermates were adopted but I didn't get adopted until late february when a great family (the toppings) took me home. I was excited I pooped on the floor! Eventaully after learning so many tricks, I was finally given my name: Appa Tornado Topping.</p>
